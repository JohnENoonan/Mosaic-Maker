# Mosaic-Maker
This is a personal project I have been working on with the goal of creating a simplified version of any given image that will create a mosaic like image. This project uses Python along with OpenCV2 and NumPY.

This project's development is currently on hold, but I expect to put more work into it this winter.

Expected funtionality includes moasaic creation as well as pointalism and cubic representations of images and videos.
